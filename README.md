# Mahanth's Portfolio v2.0

This is a revamp of my existing portfolio. The main goal is to make it look as asthetically pleasing as I possibly can at this point of being a web developer.

I will undoubtadly improve this again and agaiun as I gain more knowledge and skills over the span of my career in web dev. But for now, this is it.
